# DEFENDING CLOUD WEBSERVER AGAINST DDOS ATTACK: DETECTION, PROTECTION, AND MITIGATION
#### Executive Summary
This project presents a comprehensive defense system for cloud-hosted web servers against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. At its core is a lightweight ML-based detection module using Tsetlin Machine classifiers, combined with AWS cloud-native protection services and auto-scaling mitigation. The solution achieves 98.7% detection accuracy with minimal latency and provides interpretable rule-based explanations of threat detection.
#### 1.1 DDoS Attacks Overview
DDoS attacks aim to disrupt online services by overwhelming target servers with malicious traffic from multiple sources. These attacks can be categorized into three main types:

- Volumetric Attacks: Consume available bandwidth through amplification or flooding.
[INSERT FIGURE: Fig 1.1 Volumetric Attack Example - showing DNS amplification attack]
- Application Layer Attacks: Target web page generation processes through expensive HTTP requests. [INSERT FIGURE: Fig 1.2 Application Layer Attack Example - showing HTTP GET flood]
- Protocol Attacks: Exploit weaknesses in layer 3 and 4 of the protocol stack.
-[INSERT FIGURE: Fig 1.3 Protocol Attack Example - showing SYN flood mechanism]

These attacks can cause significant financial losses and reputational damage by disrupting the link between organizations and customers.
#### 2.1 Objectives

- Achieve â‰¥95% accuracy in DDoS attack detection
- Reduce false positive rate to <5%
- Maintain <1% downtime during attacks
- Enable auto-scaling responses within 5 minutes
- Ensure efficient resource usage (<20% CPU/memory)
- Provide interpretable detection decisions

#### 2.2 System Architecture
[INSERT FIGURE: Fig 5.1 Architecture Diagram - showing the complete system design]
The system implements a multi-layered defense:

- ML-based Detection Module: Analyzes incoming traffic to identify potential DDoS threats
- DDoS ML-based Segregation Module: Classifies specific attack types
- Defense Mechanism: Applies rules like geo-blocking and rate-limiting
- Honeypot: Traps severe attack traffic for analysis
- Mitigation Strategy: Employs AWS services for traffic management

#### 2.3 Data Flow
[INSERT FIGURE: Fig 5.2 Data Flow Diagram - showing data movement through the system]
The data flow begins with incoming requests, proceeds through packet capture, feature extraction, and classification, with appropriate actions taken based on traffic legitimacy.

#### 3. Implementation Details
##### 3.1 Packet Capture and Buffering

- Tools: Wireshark with tshark , NFstream for real-time packet capture
- Buffering: Using iptables with NFQUEUE (1000 packets or 5-second timeout)
- Processing: Conversion to JSON format with 5-tuple extraction

##### 3.2 Flow Grouping and Feature Extraction

- Tool: NFStream for real-time flow distribution
- Features: Flow_IAT_Mean, Fwd_Packets_per_s, Init_Fwd_Win_Bytes
- Preprocessing: Normalization and booleanization for Tsetlin Machine compatibility

##### 3.3 ML-based Detection with Tsetlin Machine

- Backend: FastAPI application for real-time inference
- Efficiency: Lazy loading to reduce memory overhead
- Performance: Batch processing with asyncio and ThreadPoolExecutor
- Deployment: AWS EC2 instance within a VPC

##### 3.4 Defense Mechanism (AWS-based Rules)

- AWS WAF Configuration: Five key rules implemented
- [INSERT FIGURE: Fig 6.1 AWS WAF Rules - showing the configured rules]
- Lambda Function: For automated IP blocking and traffic management
- [INSERT FIGURE: Fig 6.2 Lambda Function Algorithm - showing the decision flow]

##### 3.5 Mitigation Strategies

- DNS Rerouting: Using Route 53 for traffic redirection
- Load Balancing: ALB and NLB for traffic distribution
- Logging: CloudWatch for comprehensive activity monitoring
- EC2 Setup: Instances configured for various system components

#### 4 AWS Configuration Results
