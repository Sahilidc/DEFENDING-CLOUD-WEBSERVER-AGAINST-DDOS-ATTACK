# DEFENDING CLOUD WEBSERVER AGAINST DDOS ATTACK: DETECTION, PROTECTION, AND MITIGATION
#### Executive Summary
This project presents a comprehensive defense system for cloud-hosted web servers against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. At its core is a lightweight ML-based detection module using Tsetlin Machine classifiers, combined with AWS cloud-native protection services and auto-scaling mitigation. The solution achieves 98.7% detection accuracy with minimal latency and provides interpretable rule-based explanations of threat detection.
#### 1.1 DDoS Attacks Overview
DDoS attacks aim to disrupt online services by overwhelming target servers with malicious traffic from multiple sources. These attacks can be categorized into three main types:

- Volumetric Attacks: Consume available bandwidth through amplification or flooding.

- Application Layer Attacks: Target web page generation processes through expensive HTTP requests.

- Protocol Attacks: Exploit weaknesses in layer 3 and 4 of the protocol stack.

These attacks can cause significant financial losses and reputational damage by disrupting the link between organizations and customers.
#### 2.1 Objectives

- Achieve â‰¥95% accuracy in DDoS attack detection
- Reduce false positive rate to <5%
- Maintain <1% downtime during attacks
- Enable auto-scaling responses within 5 minutes
- Ensure efficient resource usage (<20% CPU/memory)
- Provide interpretable detection decisions

#### 2.2 System Architecture

The system implements a multi-layered defense:

- ML-based Detection Module: Analyzes incoming traffic to identify potential DDoS threats
- DDoS ML-based Segregation Module: Classifies specific attack types
- Defense Mechanism: Applies rules like geo-blocking and rate-limiting
- Honeypot: Traps severe attack traffic for analysis
- Mitigation Strategy: Employs AWS services for traffic management

#### 2.3 Data Flow

The data flow begins with incoming requests, proceeds through packet capture, feature extraction, and classification, with appropriate actions taken based on traffic legitimacy.

#### 3. Implementation Details
##### 3.1 Packet Capture and Buffering

- Tools: Wireshark with tshark , NFstream for real-time packet capture
- Buffering: Using iptables with NFQUEUE (1000 packets or 5-second timeout)
- Processing: Conversion to JSON format with 5-tuple extraction

##### 3.2 Flow Grouping and Feature Extraction

- Tool: NFStream for real-time flow distribution
- Features: Flow_IAT_Mean, Fwd_Packets_per_s, Init_Fwd_Win_Bytes
- Preprocessing: Normalization and booleanization for Tsetlin Machine compatibility

##### 3.3 ML-based Detection with Tsetlin Machine

- Backend: FastAPI application for real-time inference
- Efficiency: Lazy loading to reduce memory overhead
- Performance: Batch processing with asyncio and ThreadPoolExecutor
